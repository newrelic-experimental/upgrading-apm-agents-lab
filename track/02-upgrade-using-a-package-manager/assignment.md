Verify
=======
Your Hello New Relic app should appear in New Relic One by now.  Open up Agent Groundskeeper and see what it says.  It should be telling you that the agent is outdated, and will recommend a more recent version for you.  Remember this version number (or copy it to your clipboard).

Upgrade
=======
Open up the `package.json` file in the Source Code Editor.  Each library is specified in the `dependencies` section, where each library name is listed, followed by a colon (:) and then the version of the library, in quotes.

You should see that the version of the `newrelic` library matches what Agent Groundskeeper detected.   Replace this version with the one recommended by Agent Groundskeeper.

Remember to save your changes by clicking the icon next to the filename in the tab.

Build
=====
Now, build the app by running the following command in the Terminal tab:
```
./build.sh
```

Deploy
======
Once the app is done building, deploy it by running the following command in the terminal:
```
./deploy.sh
```

Note:  sometimes resources are not destroyed and re-created in the correct order when redeploying and you may see the following error:

```
Recreating simple-example_web_1 ... error

ERROR: for simple-example_web_1  Cannot start service web: network simple-example_default not found

ERROR: for web  Cannot start service web: network simple-example_default not found
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```

In that case, just re-run the deploy command and it should work.

After a few minutes, refresh Agent Groundskeeper to see if the new version is detected. (You may see BOTH versions reporting at first, since the old version was just recently replaced)

Takeaways:
==========
- In this challenge, we upgraded the New Relic APM agent by updating the version in the `package.json` file, which is the specification for NPM, the default *package manager* for NodeJS.
